5.0,"This is the one natural deodorant that works for me, no b.o smell throughout the day! Score. Although it will never absorb quite like those cancer causing deodorants, this is definitely a must buy!!"
5.0,"I am staying away from the conventional deodorants that have lots of fragrance combined with aluminum which is an irritant to my skin and bad for the body anyway. In my search for a product that smelled fresh enough for a woman to use and one that worked, I came upon Schmidt's charcoal. I was pleasantly surprised! It is smooth and easy to put on, it doesn't get gloppy like some, it keeps me feeling fresh all day long and it works! The price is so worth it because it lasts A LONG TIME. Try it! You'll be happy you did."
1.0,"Do not buy this from Amazon it's either defective or counterfeit. I used to buy the same product at Costco, it works great. As the picture shows there are clumps throughout the stick and it causes the product to overapply and get messy. The sticks from Costco were smooth and worked great."
3.0,"I started using this because I was getting cysts from aluminum antiperspirants. After studying the properties of charcoal in an academic setting regarding absorption of toxins in water filtration, I decided to pick this aluminum free deodorant. A few years earlier, I tried other aluminum free deodorants and they failed miserably. It smells good, with a mineraly fresh scent. I have sensitive skin, especially after shaving. After going to the dermatologist because I thought I had a serious rash with a burning sensation, we figured it was this deodorant. Now I know not to apply this deodorant the day or two after shaving. I reccomend this if you do not shave often. Also, it does stain gray and oily. Do not wear this on thin, light, or nice clothes. Good for wearing with neutral colored sweaters, for example. As for sweat prevention and odor reduction, it was satisfactory. I live in the northeast US, where we have cold winters and humid hot summers, so it was good for fall, winter and spring. Definitely did not do the job in summer. Also not as effective during exercise. Overall, this was a good alternative to aluminum antiperspirant when I am wearing thicker clothes I do not care about too much, in the colder months, when I am not exercising, and when I have not shaved for a day or two. To me, its better than constantly using aluminum antiperspirant."
1.0,Dont buy this from amazon!!!! I never write reviews but felt others should know this. I’ve been using this deodorant for a while and purchased it this time from amazon. It isn’t the real product and the charcoal chunks will tear your armpits up.
5.0,Great natural deodorant! It works!
5.0,Great for those who are sensitive to perfumed deorderants! Nice smell & works great!
2.0,"Well I stopped using it today. Gave it about 3 weeks and honestly it wasn't bad smelling, didn't react terribly bc you really didn't need much and it did ok w sweat. Not near as good as antiperspirant but good enough especially for winter. What I realized last night is it is staining my shirts. I'm not gonna wear something that destroys my clothes."
3.0,"I was excited to try this deodorant. I have been wanting to find a good non-aluminum deodorant. I've used Dove for years with no problem, but I've read that non-aluminum deodorants are better for you. I had this on for maybe 10-15 minutes before the discomfort started. A couple hours later, it felt like I'd taken sandpaper to my underarms. I was stuck at work and couldn't do anything about it... No way to rinse it off or apply any cream. By the time I got home from work, I was in agony. My skin felt so burned and scraped, and every time my arm moved across it sent a new sear of pain. I got my shirt off and looked at my underarms and they were so red and raw looking. I hadn't shaved (the deodorant advises against it), so that wasn't the issue. It took a few days for the burning ache to go away. oh well, so it goes. It smelled great!"

5.0,"Excellent mustard, I highly recommend"
5.0,Tastes great!
5.0,Fantastic delicious I used it in everything since I couldn't get enough of the flavor
4.0,"First, this is a bit pricier than the usual store bought but I couldn't resist trying it. It definitely has a different spice pop to it. It also does not seem to separate as easily as the usual. Probably won't purchase again."
5.0,I have been using this product for several months and it works! and I do not have to worry about aluminum passing thru my pores! Very quick delivery! and a very good price too! Thank you!
4.0,I get rashes from almost all deodorants but did not get one from using this product
5.0,"Since it is not an anti-perspirant my armpits still got sweaty but, the smell is pleasant and I did not stink by the end of my work day. Oretty good product"
1.0,"Very very Strong scent!!!!!i threw it away. I thought since it was supposed to be for sensitive people , it wouldn’t be scented."
2.0,Not sure what Bieber was on when he approved this. It has the smell of cheap soap.
5.0,"I love this stuff. I tried so many different products. Toms of Maine would not keep Mr onion away! This product is Yummy! It keeps the funk back because it stays on, it is thicker. I no longer have redness under arms either!"
5.0,"Ok this is the best natural deodorant I’ve tried so far probably won’t try any other, but I haven’t tried it in the hot summertime yet. I’ll see how I like it then hopefully it will still work as well."
4.0,"Very interesting smell to start with. Sort of citrus and fennel scent or somewhat like dried bael fruit. Doesn't seem to protect as long as other Schmidt's deodorants, but this could just be me YMMV."
5.0,Me and my husband enjoyed the smell and the coverage!
5.0,I have been on a quest for a good Deodorant for the past year. I have a baking soda allergy in my deodorant so it is harder to find. I’ve tried about a dozen so far and this one works the best. My whole family is choosing this one and I have been throwing the others out since no one wants to use them.
1.0,I had to stop using this after two days because the smell was so bad. It honestly makes you smell like a dying old man.

4.0,"The only thing I dislike are the seeds. However, for its cleansing, scent and moisturizer I like it."
5.0,Really like this soap so far. Been using it for a week now. Great scent and moisturizing. Also like that it's a big bar of soap. Last longer for the money. Overall very pleased.

5.0,So delicious. I can only buy this every few months. So good I’ll eat it all at once
5.0,Fabulous fabulous fabulous I can’t get enough of this!!!
3.0,"One thing I've learned after trying (8) different flavors of Talenti Gelato is that any one flavor IS NOT FOR EVERYONE! I DISLIKED (5) of the (8) flavors I tried & I dislike ALL the multi-layer flavors! At the price-point for these, DISLIKING ONE is a GREAT LOSS! -- I LOVE the Vanilla Blueberry Crumble (which can be VERY EXPENSIVE!), the Caramel Cookie Crunch & the cold Coffee Brew is pretty good."
5.0,The best combination of chocolate & carmel salty & sweet truly awesome wonderland icecream experience.
5.0,Loved it.
5.0,Sooo good! This has to be the best idea they ever had! The chocolate cruchies! The caramel Gelato! The caramel sauce! The caramel truffles! And the vanilla just perfectly set it off! This is seriously good!
5.0,SheaMoisture lavender wild orchid oil makes your skin feel so smooth .i also like the scent nice and light.
5.0,I love this product.
5.0,"I love this oil. I use it after my shower, before I towel off. It leaves my skin silky and the scent is delicate."
5.0,"This is officially my favorite brand of oils. I have really dry skin and would run through other oils because of having to re-apply up to six times a day. With this brand I use it after a morning shower and right before bed in a warm bath. The smell is amazing and lingers lightly, which I love. Will buy more!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this body oil! The combined oils and scents used are perfect. I like that it is a natural, organic, fair trade, and family product!"
