# Building a Simple AI Text Completion App with OpenAI’s API

This guide walks through creating a basic **Python** application that uses OpenAI’s API for text completion. We’ll cover setting up your environment, writing the script, handling common issues, testing with various prompts, and evaluating the AI’s behavior. Each step is kept simple so you can run the app locally without exposing your API key.

## 1. Setting Up the Environment

To get started, ensure your development environment is prepared with the necessary tools and credentials:

1. **Install the OpenAI Python library** – Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Install the `openai` SDK via pip. For example, run:  
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ``` 
   This will install OpenAI’s official Python package and its dependencies ([A Step by Step Guide to Using the OpenAI Python API - Doprax](https://www.doprax.com/tutorial/a-step-by-step-guide-to-using-the-openai-python-api/#:~:text=following%20command%20in%20your%20terminal%3A)).

2. **Obtain an OpenAI API key** – Sign up on the OpenAI platform if you haven’t already. After logging in, navigate to the **API Keys** page to create a new secret key ([A Step by Step Guide to Using the OpenAI Python API - Doprax](https://www.doprax.com/tutorial/a-step-by-step-guide-to-using-the-openai-python-api/#:~:text=To%20use%20the%20OpenAI%20API%2C,keys)). Copy this key (it starts with `sk-...`) – you’ll need it to authenticate API calls.

3. **Securely store the API key** – **Do not** hard-code your secret key directly in your script. Instead, set it as an environment variable on your system (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) or use a local `.env` file. For example, you can create a `.env` file containing:  
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ``` 
   In your Python code, read this value so the key isn’t exposed in your codebase. Using environment variables (or a package like `python-dotenv`) keeps your key secret ([Openai Organization Python Guide | Restackio](https://www.restack.io/p/openai-python-answer-organization-cat-ai#:~:text=import%20os%20import%20openai)). For instance: 
   ```python
   import os
   import openai
   openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # Load API key from env variable
   ```
   This way, the key is loaded at runtime and not visible in your code repository ([Openai Organization Python Guide | Restackio](https://www.restack.io/p/openai-python-answer-organization-cat-ai#:~:text=import%20os%20import%20openai)).

## 2. Developing the Application

With the environment ready, you can develop the text completion script. The application will take user input, send it to the OpenAI API, and display the completion result:

1. **Import libraries and configure API key** – In your Python script, import the `openai` library (and `os` if using environment variables). Set the API key as shown above so the library knows your credentials.

2. **Accept dynamic user input** – Use Python’s `input()` function to prompt the user for text. This makes the application interactive. For example:  
   ```python
   user_prompt = input("Enter a prompt for the AI: ")
   ``` 
   Before calling the API, you may want to strip whitespace and ensure the prompt isn’t empty.

3. **Call the OpenAI completion API** – Use the OpenAI SDK to create a completion request with the user’s prompt. You can use a GPT-3 model like `text-davinci-003` for general text tasks. For example:  
   ```python
   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-003",   # or model="text-davinci-003"
       prompt=user_prompt,
       max_tokens=100,
       temperature=0.7
   )
   ``` 
   Here, `max_tokens` limits the response length and `temperature` controls creativity (more on these later). The API returns a response object containing one or more completions.

4. **Display the AI’s response** – Extract the generated text from the response and print it for the user. Typically, you can get it from `response.choices[0].text`. For example:  
   ```python
   completion_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
   print("AI response:", completion_text)
   ``` 
   Stripping whitespace is useful to clean up the output. Now the user can see the completion result.

5. **(Optional) Loop for multiple prompts** – To allow continuous interaction, wrap the prompt-and-response logic in a loop. For instance, keep asking the user for a prompt until they type a quit command (like "exit"). This way, you don’t have to restart the program for each query.

**Example:** Below is a simple script putting these pieces together:

```python
import os
import openai

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # Set your API key from environment

while True:
    user_prompt = input("Enter a prompt (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    if not user_prompt or user_prompt.lower() == "quit":
        break  # exit loop if input is empty or user types 'quit'
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-003",
            prompt=user_prompt,
            max_tokens=100,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        result = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        print(f"AI: {result}\n")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error with OpenAI API request:", e)
```

This script continuously takes prompts and prints out the AI’s completion. You can run it in a terminal; it will respond to each prompt until you type "quit".

## 3. Debugging Common Issues

When building and running your app, you may encounter some common issues. Below are troubleshooting tips for the most frequent problems:

- **API connection errors** – If the request fails to reach OpenAI’s servers (e.g., a network error or timeout), check your internet connection. Ensure that the `openai` package is installed correctly and that your environment allows outgoing HTTPS requests. If you’re behind a firewall or proxy, you might need to configure that for Python. Also, verify that you’re using the correct API endpoint via the library (the OpenAI Python SDK handles this by default).

- **Invalid or incorrect API key** – If the API returns an authentication error (for example: `openai.error.AuthenticationError: Incorrect API key provided`), it means the key is missing or wrong. Double-check that you set the API key value correctly in your environment and that it matches the key from your OpenAI dashboard ([Incorrect API key provided | OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6882433-incorrect-api-key-provided#:~:text=Check%20your%20API%20key%20at,for%20the%20request%20you%27re%20making)). Ensure there are no extra characters or spaces. If you have multiple keys, confirm you’re using the intended one and it hasn’t been revoked. Using the environment variable method helps prevent mistakes like accidentally committing the key or using an outdated one.

- **Empty or irrelevant prompts** – If the user input is empty or just whitespace, the API call will either return an error or an irrelevant result. Always validate the user input in your code. If `user_prompt.strip()` is empty, prompt the user again instead of calling the API. Additionally, for very short or vague prompts, the AI might produce a generic or confusing completion. It’s often helpful to guide the user to provide a clear question or request for better results.

- **Adjusting output length and creativity** – The behavior of the AI’s response can be tuned with parameters:
  - **`max_tokens`**: This parameter sets the **maximum number of tokens** (words or sub-word units) in the generated completion. A higher `max_tokens` allows longer responses, but setting it too high may return overly verbose answers. For example, if you want a brief answer, you might set `max_tokens=50`. *(Note: The prompt length + `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model’s limit, which is around 2048 or more tokens for modern models.)* ([Clarification for max_tokens - API - OpenAI Developer Community](https://community.openai.com/t/clarification-for-max-tokens/19576#:~:text=,newest%20models%2C%20which%20support%204096)) 
  - **`temperature`**: This controls the **randomness/creativity** of the output. It ranges from 0 to 2. Higher values (closer to 1 or above) make the output more random and creative, while lower values (closer to 0) make it more focused and deterministic ([OpenAI | Promptly](https://docs.trypromptly.com/processors/openai#:~:text=,to%20generate%20in%20the%20completion)). For instance, `temperature=0.8` might give imaginative or surprising phrasing, whereas `temperature=0` makes the model respond in a very predictable manner. If you find the output too random or off-topic, lower the temperature; if it’s too dull or repetitive, try increasing it. 

  You can experiment with these settings to fix issues like responses that are too short (increase `max_tokens`) or text that seems irrelevant or nonsensical (consider lowering `temperature`). The OpenAI API also provides other parameters (like `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, etc.), but for simplicity, focusing on `max_tokens` and `temperature` is enough to fine-tune basic behavior.

## 4. Testing the Application

After implementing the application, it’s important to test it with different kinds of prompts to see how it performs. Run your script and try the following scenarios one by one, observing the output each time:

- **Writing a poem** – *Test:* Enter a prompt like: `"Write a short poem about the sunrise."`  
  *Expected:* The AI should produce a poetic piece, often with multiple lines and a creative, descriptive style.

- **Completing a sentence** – *Test:* Provide a sentence stem, such as: `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy"` (without finishing it).  
  *Expected:* The AI will continue the sentence, e.g., completing it with something like `"dog."` (or a longer continuation), demonstrating its ability to predict likely continuations.

- **Answering a question** – *Test:* Ask a factual question: `"What is the capital of France?"`  
  *Expected:* The AI should respond with a direct answer (e.g., `"Paris."`). It uses its trained knowledge to answer straightforward factual queries.

- **Writing a creative story** – *Test:* Prompt a story: `"Tell a short story about a dragon who learns to fly."`  
  *Expected:* You should get a narrative few-paragraph story involving a dragon. The style will be imaginative and story-like, showing how the model handles creative storytelling.

- **Summarizing a paragraph** – *Test:* Provide a longer text and ask for a summary. For example, input a few sentences about a topic (you can paste a short article or write a long sentence), then prompt: `"Summarize the above paragraph."`  
  *Expected:* The AI will produce a condensed version of the content, capturing the main point in a few sentences. This shows the model’s ability to condense information.

- **Explaining a concept in simple terms** – *Test:* Ask for an explanation: `"Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms."`  
  *Expected:* The AI should output a simplified explanation of the concept, avoiding jargon – for instance, comparing it to everyday ideas. This demonstrates how the model can adapt to an instructive, educational tone.

For each of these tests, observe how the **style and content** of the output change based on your prompt. The same AI model can shift from poetic to factual to narrative, solely depending on the prompt given. All the above prompts are handled by the same `Completion.create` call in your script – illustrating the versatility of the model. If any output doesn’t seem right (e.g., the story is too short or the summary misses details), consider tweaking the prompt or the parameters as mentioned earlier.

## 5. Evaluating the Model’s Behavior

Finally, take some time to evaluate how your application (and the underlying model) is performing. This involves experimenting with settings and reflecting on the quality of the AI’s responses:

- **Experiment with different settings** – Try changing the `temperature` and `max_tokens` values to see how the output varies. For example, take a single prompt (say, the story about the dragon) and run it with `temperature=0.2`, then with `temperature=0.9`. Compare the creativity of the two outputs. Likewise, test a prompt with a low `max_tokens` (e.g., 50) versus a high value (e.g., 150) to see the difference in response length. Through these experiments, you’ll notice how **higher temperature yields more imaginative but sometimes less focused results, whereas lower temperature gives more straightforward answers ([OpenAI | Promptly](https://docs.trypromptly.com/processors/openai#:~:text=,to%20generate%20in%20the%20completion))**. Similarly, a higher `max_tokens` allows more detailed answers, but if it's set too high, the model might produce unnecessary verbosity or even go off-track.

- **Observe response quality** – Assess whether the outputs make sense and satisfy the prompts. In many cases, you’ll find the model’s responses are impressively coherent and relevant for well-phrased prompts. The AI excels at producing fluent, grammatically correct text and can follow the prompt’s instruction or style (rhyming for poems, descriptive for stories, concise for summaries, etc.). This showcases the **strengths** of the model, such as versatility in language and creativity in content generation.

- **Note the limitations** – It’s equally important to recognize where the model might falter:
  - The AI might sometimes give **incorrect or nonsensical answers** that sound confident. (OpenAI has acknowledged that *“ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.”* ([Introducing ChatGPT | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/#:~:text=%2A%20ChatGPT%20sometimes%20writes%20plausible,3%29%20supervised))) This tendency, often called a *hallucination*, means you shouldn’t take every response as factually accurate without verification.
  - The model’s **knowledge is limited to its training data**. For instance, if you ask about very recent events or newly emerged information, the model may not know the answer or could be outdated. (Most GPT-3 based models have a knowledge cutoff around 2021, so they lack awareness of events after that date.) ([I thought the knowledge cutoff was 2021? Strange. : r/ChatGPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11qcp3a/i_thought_the_knowledge_cutoff_was_2021_strange/#:~:text=I%20thought%20the%20knowledge%20cutoff,that%20ChatGPT%20itself%20doesn%27t)) 
  - The AI might require clear instructions for complex tasks. If a prompt is ambiguous or open-ended, the response might be off-target or generic. You may need to refine your prompt or provide more context to get better results.
  - There are also usage limits and costs to consider (each API call consumes tokens, which are billed), but for a simple test application with a few prompts, this isn’t usually an issue. Just be aware if you plan to scale up usage.

- **Record your observations** – As you test different prompts and settings, it’s helpful to write down how the model behaves. Note things like: Did the response address the query correctly? Was the tone appropriate? Did increasing the temperature make the story more interesting, or just more random? Keeping a log of these results will help you understand the model’s strengths (like creative writing and general knowledge answers) and its weaknesses (such as factual inaccuracies or occasional off-topic rambling).

By following this guide, you have set up a basic yet functional AI text completion application. You can input any prompt and get a generated completion from the AI. You’ve also learned how to adjust the behavior and handle common issues. This foundation opens the door to integrating AI text generation into more complex applications and exploring more advanced features of OpenAI’s API in the future. Good luck, and happy coding!
