    "For this project, you’ll create a simple yet addictive number-guessing game. Here’s how it works:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Generate a Random Number**  \n",
    "Use Python’s `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "`import random`\n",
    "\n",
    "`number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)`\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Prompt the User for Guesses**  \n",
    "Use a `while` loop to let the user keep guessing until they get the correct answer. After each guess:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If the guess is too high, print: \"Too high! Try again.\"\n",
    "-   If the guess is too low, print: \"Too low! Try again.\"\n",
    "-   If the guess is correct, print: \"Congratulations! You guessed it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Count the Attempts**  \n",
    "Keep track of how many guesses the user has made and display the total number of attempts when they win.\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Run:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 50 Too high! Try again.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 25 Too low! Try again.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 37 Congratulations! You guessed it in 3 attempts!`\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Task:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Limit the number of attempts to 10. If the user fails to guess in 10 attempts, end the game with a message like \"Game over! Better luck next time!\"\n",

    "Make your program friendly, interactive, and fun to play! 😊\n",
