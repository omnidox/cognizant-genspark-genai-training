    "### **Step 1: Concept Check (Multiple Choice Questions)**\n",
    "We already have the correct answers:\n",
    "1. **Main benefit of fine-tuning** → **B) It customizes the model for specific tasks or domains.**\n",
    "2. **Catastrophic forgetting** → **B) When the model loses its generalization ability after excessive fine-tuning on a specific task.**\n",

    "### **Step 2: Transfer Learning Explanation (150-200 words)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Transfer Learning: A Real-World Analogy**\n",
    "Imagine a professional chef who has mastered French cuisine. If they decide to learn Italian cooking, they don’t start from scratch—they already understand knife skills, seasoning techniques, and food presentation. Instead, they refine their knowledge by focusing on Italian ingredients and recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, transfer learning in deep learning allows a pre-trained model to apply its general knowledge to a new task with minimal retraining. For instance, a language model trained on vast amounts of text can be fine-tuned for legal document analysis by feeding it law-specific data. Instead of training a model from scratch, which is resource-intensive, fine-tuning an existing model adapts it to specialized tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is widely used in fields like healthcare, where a general image recognition model can be fine-tuned on medical scans to detect diseases with higher accuracy. By leveraging pre-trained knowledge, transfer learning enhances performance while reducing computational cost and training time.\n",

    "### **Step 3: Example Dataset Structure for Fine-Tuning**\n",
    "We need to pick a specific fine-tuning task. Let’s go with **sentiment analysis on customer reviews**. Here’s a structured dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| review_id | text                                         | label   |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------------------------------------|--------|\n",
    "| 1         | \"The product was amazing! Highly recommend.\" | Positive |\n",
    "| 2         | \"Terrible experience. Will not buy again.\"   | Negative |\n",
    "| 3         | \"It works fine, but delivery was late.\"      | Neutral  |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cleaning Steps:**\n",
    "- Remove special characters and unnecessary whitespace.\n",
    "- Normalize text (convert to lowercase, remove stopwords if necessary).\n",
    "- Balance the dataset (ensure equal representation of classes).\n",
